# fashion-detection-using-cnn
Deep learning project for fashion item detection and classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

This project focuses on Fashion Detection and Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to automatically recognize and categorize fashion items (e.g., shirts, trousers, dresses, shoes, bags) from images, enabling applications in e-commerce, retail, and visual search.

Key features of this project:

🖼️ Dataset: Fashion-MNIST / custom fashion datasets.

🧠 Deep Learning Models: CNN architectures implemented from scratch and with TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch.

🎨 Image Preprocessing: normalization, augmentation, and resizing for robust training.

📊 Training & Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and visualization of learning curves.

🚀 Applications: product recommendation systems, e-commerce search engines, smart retail solutions.

The repository includes clean, reproducible code for data preprocessing, CNN training, evaluation, and visualizations to showcase model performance.
